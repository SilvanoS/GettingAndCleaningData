# CodeBook

The files we have to analyze are stored in a folder called 'UCI HAR Dataset'.  
See the README.txt file for the detailed information on the dataset.    
The files that will be used to load data are listed as follows:

test/subject_test.txt  
test/X_test.txt   
test/Y_test.txt   
train/subject_train.txt   
train/X_train.txt   
train/Y_train.txt   

Values of Variable Activity consist of data from "Y_train and Y_test.txt”
Values of Variable Subject consist of data from “subject_train.txt” and subject_test.txt"
Values of Varibles Features consist of data from “X_train.txt” and “X_test.txt”
Names of Variables Features come from “features.txt”
levels of Variable Activity come from “activity_labels.txt”  

So we will use Activity, Subject and Features as part of descriptive variable names for data in data frame.

The files we have to analyze are stored in a folder called 'UCI HAR Dataset'.  
See the README.txt file for the detailed information on the dataset.    
The files that will be used to load data are listed as follows:

test/subject_test.txt  
test/X_test.txt   
test/y_test.txt   
train/subject_train.txt   
train/X_train.txt   
train/y_train.txt
